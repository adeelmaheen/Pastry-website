The website promotes a delightful bakery experience, showcasing freshly baked pastries and premium coffee. It includes sections such as Home, Menu, About Us, and a table booking form, creating an inviting platform for pastry and coffee lovers.

## Features

- **Header Section**: A welcoming introduction with a call-to-action for dining or booking a table.
- **Popular Menu**: Showcases popular pastries with images and prices, including items like Caramel Pecan Cinnamon Roll and Chocolate Croissant.

- **About Section**: Highlights the bakery’s mission, passion for quality, and commitment to creating joyful moments.
- **Footer**: Includes links to blogs, new menu items, social media, and the bakery’s logo, along with a copyright notice.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For the website structure.
- **CSS3**: For styling (via `styles.css`).
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity (via `main.js`).
- **Remixicon**: For icons (version 4.6.0, via `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/remixicon@4.6.0/fonts/remixicon.css`).
- **ScrollReveal**: For scroll-based animations (via `https://unpkg.com/scrollreveal`).
- **Assets**: Images for the logo, menu items, and about section.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the website structure.
- `styles.css`: Custom CSS for styling the website.
- `main.js`: JavaScript file for handling interactivity and animations.
- `assets/`: Directory containing images used across the website (e.g., `logo.png`, `menu-1.jpg`, `about.png`, etc.).

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone or Download**: Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. **Open `index.html`**: Use a web browser to open the `index.html` file or serve it via a local server (e.g., using `Live Server` in VS Code).
3. **Dependencies**:
   - The website uses external CDNs for Remixicon (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/remixicon@4.6.0/fonts/remixicon.css`) and ScrollReveal (`https://unpkg.com/scrollreveal`).
   - Ensure an internet connection to load these resources, or host them locally if needed.
4. **Assets**: Ensure the `assets/` directory is in the same directory as `index.html` to load images correctly.

## Usage
- Navigate using the top navigation bar or the mobile menu (accessible via the hamburger icon).
- Explore the Menu section to view popular pastries and their prices.
- Use the table booking form to reserve a spot by entering your details.
- Read about the bakery’s story and mission in the About section.
- Access blogs, new menu items, or social media links via the footer.

## Notes
- The website assumes the presence of a `styles.css` file for styling and a `main.js` file for JavaScript functionality. Ensure these files are properly linked and implemented.
- Image paths in the `assets/` directory must match the referenced filenames in `index.html`.
- The table booking form is a placeholder and requires backend integration for functionality.
